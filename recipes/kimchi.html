<h1>Directions</h1>

<h2>Step 1</h2>
Cut the cabbage leaves into 2 inch long pieces. Spread 1/4 of the leaves into a large, non-metallic bowl and sprinkle
with 1/4 of the salt. Repeat layering all of the cabbage has been salted. Let stand at room temperature until a lot of
liquid has been pulled from the leaves and the cabbage is tender, 3 to 4 hours; drain. Rinse the cabbage in 2 or 3
changes of water. Drain again very well and return the cabbage to the mixing bowl.

<h2>Step 2</h2>
Sprinkle the cabbage with the minced garlic, green onions, MSG, and red pepper flakes. Season to taste with additional
salt and toss until evenly combined. Pack the mixture into a sterilized gallon-sized glass jar. Cover the jar with wax
paper and a loose fitting lid so the seal is not airtight.

<h2>Step 3</h2>
Allow the cabbage to ferment at room temperature until it reaches the desired degree of sourness, 2 to 5 days. Store in
an airtight jar in the refrigerator.
